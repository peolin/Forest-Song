The cold is seeping into my bones. I've been wandering for hours, searching for a way out of this endless maze of trees and snow. My feet are numb, and I can barely feel my fingers. I'm so tired, and I just want to lay down and give up. But I can't. I have to keep going. I have to find a way out. But what's the point? Even if I do make it out of here, what's waiting for me? A life without purpose, without meaning. A life where everything is just empty and meaningless. Maybe it would be better if I just stayed here in the woods. At least then I wouldn't have to deal with the pain of living. I could just let the cold take me, and then it would all be over. I'm so lost. Lost in the woods, lost in my own mind. I don't know what to do. I don't know where to go. I'm just... lost. Why does everything have to be so hard? Why do I have to suffer like this? What did I do to deserve this kind of pain? I'm so alone. No one knows where I am. No one cares. I'm just a lost soul in the middle of the woods, and no one is coming to save me. I don't know how much longer I can keep going. The darkness is closing in, and I'm so tired. Maybe it's time to just... let go. Maybe it's time to just... give up.
